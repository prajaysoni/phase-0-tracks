First, I'm going to do a quick google search for some good looking cheat sheets.

After bookmarking them, I'll search for some concise beginner videos.

After spending about 45 minutes or so watching videos, I'll spend rest of the time
experimenting.

In between the videos and the experimenting, I'll look through the cheat sheets to
see what I can understand from them.

While experimenting, I'll use the video examples along with the cheat sheets.

Watching videos was pretty helpful. It was interesting to see how jQuery works and
learn more about it. Trying some sample code was helpful too.
I actually ended up watching more videos that I wanted. For me, taking a break didn't
help too much. When I got back, I had forgotten some of the material I had just learned
and had to go back and rewatch certain parts.

# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control is basically what it sounds like. Generally, multiple people work on a project together. Each will have their own task to do. After a person finished their task, they would update the code and create a new version. By doing so, not only are you organized, but also creating a safety in case something happens to your computer.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is a seperate line of development that won't effect the work other people are doing on a project. You would use a branch if you have a specific task to do on a project. Take a fighting game for instance. A branch for that can be each individual character that will be in the game. If there are 10, then there would be ten seperate branches created and eventually merged into the master.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is basically like a save point. When a person is working on a project, they would make a commit after finishing up a portion of their work. This is done for safety and good organization. A good commit message is a simple one. It should get straight to the point of what was done to the code.

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict is an error that would occur when merging two branches. This can happen for a few different reasons. One of them is that if your partner edited bits of code that you were working on. Your line 34 could be a comment, while his may be starting an if statement. Maybe they edited out certain parts that you changed on your branch. It can even be simply you both are using files with the same name.

### These are the questions on the criteria

* Explain reasons for using GitHub.

The main two reasons are safety and organization. By storing all your files on the cloud, you can be sure that if anything were to happen to your computers or servers, all your projects would be safe online. Also, it has a good interface that allows you to be very organized with all your works, past and present.
Another reason is ease of access. If all the work files were only on a company server, each employee would always need to be able to access the server. With the projects on GitHub, developers would be able to remotely work on a project without being in an office. A manager would also be able to oversee progress without being present in the office.

* Explain the difference between Git and GitHub.

Git is a version control system. It lets the user work on projects and and maintain a clear histroy of said projects from start to finish.
GitHub is a place where users can store and access repositories. They can also copy other repositories to work on.

* Explain the three states of a file in Git.
The first state is when you create or edit a file.
You would then stage or add the file to be committed.
Finally, you would commit the file and save it.

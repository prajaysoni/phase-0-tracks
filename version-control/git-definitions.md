# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

It allows us to manage multiple copies of our code in case we need to go back to and older version or make changes on one that was previously updated. It saves us the trouble of having to rewrite the entire code and we just have to make the needed changes. 

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

It's a modification of our base code which we can update independently and merge it back to the master code to put the changes into effect. We'll use it in case we want to make modifications and allows multiple people to work on one project at the same time. 

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

It's when we send through our changes that we've staged. It's the second part of ensuring that our changes go through. A good commit message is clear and specific about the changes that was made so others know what was done. 

* What is a merge conflict?

When two people are working on the same file and make changes to the EXACT same line, when a merge is attempted you'll get a conflict. The computer won't know which changes to accept until everything is resolved. It will tell you where the conflict is and you'll have to decide who's changes to go with or if new changes need to be made.
